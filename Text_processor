#! python

# Text processor
# 1 How many times the input letter appears on input text
# 2 How many words compose the input text
# 3 The first and last letters
# 4 Text words in reverse order
# 5 Is the word 'python' on text?

# Asking for input data
text = input("Write your text to process: ")
letter1 = input("Write the first letter: ")
letter2 = input("Write the second letter: ")
letter3 = input("Write the third letter: ")

# First task
my_list = list(text.lower()) #Casting string to list
print(f"The letter {letter1} appears on the text {my_list.count(letter1)} times") #Using methd 'count' with argument the letter that gives me an integer
print(f"The letter {letter2} appears on the text {my_list.count(letter2)} times")
print(f"The letter {letter3} appears on the text {my_list.count(letter3)} times")

# Second task
list_num_words = my_list.count(" ") + 1 #Here IÂ´m counting the number of blank spaces on my list plus 1, so that give me the number of words
print(f"The total number of words on text is: {list_num_words}")

# Third task
print(f"The first letter on text is {my_list[0]} and the last is {my_list[-1]}") #Using my list indexes, Im printing the first element and tthe last starting the count in reverse

# Fourth task
list_splitted = text.split(" ") #Using split method I did separate all words between blank spaces
list_splitted.reverse() #Now with reverse method the list is in invert order
print("The text invert order is: " + " ".join(list_splitted)) #With join method the elements from list create 1 string separeted by blank spaces

# Fifth task
my_dic = {True:'The text have the python word on it',False:'The text does not have the python word on it'} #Dictionary with the options to choose after validation
print(dic['python' in list_splitted]) #Prints the result of the validation with operator *in* wich returns boolean value
